# covid_real_time_kaggle

Real time face mask prediction model with 94 % accuracy with many faces in a image.It can track as many faces and in the real time detect the mask with open cv.
This will be furthur enhanced using capturing person's image with no mask and sending them an alert. 
There are 3 classes for prediction are:
1 mask on the face
2 no mask on the face
3 mask not properly weared


Used a basic architecture as when used mobilenet got accuracy of 86% so used basic self made architecture.
